## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. I have fixed the two identified deficiencies:

* References are updated to use angle brackets e.g. <doi:10.1111/ajps.12185>.
* \value tags are added for all exported functions.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
* NOTE is from unrecognized (but correct) spellings of the names of P. Aronow (Yale) and C. Samii (NYU).
